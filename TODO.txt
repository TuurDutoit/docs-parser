Parser TODO:
============

* Replace tabs with spaces

* parser options, e.g.:
    node parser md json/core.json -o "hello:hi,bye:hi"
    
    -> Passed to parser.parseOptions(options)
    -> Result: in program.options


* Type: external
    {
        "type": "core>Vector"
    }
    
    Would create a link to the Vector class docs.

* Escaped external (e.g.: ingored external): start with \ (backslash):
    {
        "type": "\Vector"
    }
    
    Would NOT (try to) import the Vector file. (normally tries to import external)



* List import:
    If the imported file contains an array (and the source string is in an array), import the elements of the external array into the source array.
    e.g.:
        source: [element0, "somefile"] and somefile: [element1, element2, element3]
        then source would become: [element0, element1, element2, element3]


* Remember constructors:
    Remember constructors, so types can be referenced with just the name of the constructor (instead of the whole external)


* Private properties
    {
        private: true
    }
    
    would make the property private, adding a 'private' notice to the labels.


* Max. number of parent levels to show


* Do not show parent of constructors (for properties of that constructor)
